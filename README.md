# Introduction to Parallel Programming - Labs

This repository contains the lab assignments from the **Introduction to Parallel Programming** course. The labs focus on implementing parallel computing techniques using various frameworks and technologies in C. The repository is organized into three folders, one for each lab.

## About
The labs aim to introduce fundamental concepts and practices of parallel programming. Each lab focuses on a specific framework or technology:
1. **Lab 1:** OpenMP for shared-memory parallelism.
2. **Lab 2:** MPI (Message Passing Interface) for distributed-memory parallelism.
3. **Lab 3:** OpenACC and CUDA for GPU computing.

Each lab folder includes:
- A PDF document detailing the lab description and requirements (provided by the university).
- The code files containing the implemented solutions.

## Technologies Used
- **C** for implementation.
- **OpenMP** for shared-memory parallelism.
- **MPI** for message-passing parallelism.
- **OpenACC** for directive-based GPU programming.
- **CUDA** for GPU computing.
